🔧 Engineering / Technical Depth

Testing

Unit tests (e.g. Jest/React Testing Library for frontend, Go’s built-in testing for backend).

Integration tests (make sure API and DB interactions work as expected).

End-to-end tests (Playwright or Cypress for simulating user flows).

Caching & Performance

Query caching on frontend (React Query/TanStack Query or SWR).

Backend caching (Redis or in-memory caching in Go).

Optimistic updates on frontend to make the app feel snappy.

Authentication / Authorization

Add user accounts (e.g. Supabase Auth, or JWTs in Go).

Role-based access (regular user vs. admin/coach).

CI/CD

GitHub Actions (run tests on PRs, auto-deploy main branch).

Containerization with Docker → deploy to something like Fly.io, Render, or AWS.

Type Safety & Validation

End-to-end types (TypeScript + Go structs with validation).

Input validation (zod or yup on frontend, Go validator on backend).

📊 Features Recruiters Love Seeing

Analytics & Insights

Progress graphs (already working).

Personal bests / streak tracking.

Comparisons over time (e.g. "Your bench press improved by 20% in 3 months").

Offline / Mobile Friendly

PWA support (installable on mobile).

LocalStorage or IndexedDB sync so it works offline.

Search & Filtering

Filter workouts by muscle group, equipment, etc.

Autocomplete (your combobox is already halfway there).

Export / Share

Export logs as CSV/Excel.

Shareable progress reports.

🛠️ “Production-Ready” Touches

Error handling & loading states

Skeleton loaders, error boundaries.

Accessibility

Keyboard navigation, screen reader support.

Security

Rate limiting, SQL injection prevention.

Documentation

A polished README with setup instructions, screenshots, maybe even a short demo video.

🚀 How This Reads on a Resume

Instead of just “Built a workout tracker with React and Go,” you’d be able to say something like:

Fitness Tracking Web App — Built a full-stack fitness tracker with React (Next.js) frontend, Go backend, and PostgreSQL database. Implemented authentication, data visualization (progress charts, personal records), query caching with React Query, and containerized deployment with Docker. Wrote unit/integration tests and set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

That communicates:

✅ You know full-stack web dev

✅ You care about performance, testing, and real-world reliability

✅ You have exposure to modern tooling companies actually use



Perfect — let’s make this practical. Here’s a resume polish roadmap with the 3 most impactful things you can add next (without going overboard):

🥇 Step 1: Add Authentication (User Accounts)

Why? Recruiters love projects that handle real-world users, since auth is almost always needed in production apps.

How?

Use Supabase Auth (easy, integrates with your existing Supabase).

Or add JWT auth in Go for more backend control.

Store user-specific workout logs.

Resume bullet you unlock: “Implemented secure user authentication and per-user data storage with Supabase/Auth.”

🥈 Step 2: Add Testing + CI

Why? Shows engineering maturity — most hobby projects don’t bother with tests, but production apps do.

How?

Write a few unit tests (Go’s built-in testing pkg for backend, Jest/RTL for frontend).

Add a GitHub Actions workflow: run tests on every pull request.

Resume bullet: “Wrote unit and integration tests with automated CI pipeline (GitHub Actions).”

🥉 Step 3: Add Query Caching (React Query or SWR)

Why? Demonstrates performance awareness and modern frontend patterns. Recruiters will recognize React Query immediately.

How?

Replace useEffect + fetch with useQuery (React Query).

Add optimistic updates when logging a new workout.

Resume bullet: “Optimized frontend data fetching with React Query for caching and optimistic UI updates.”

🎯 Bonus (if you still have energy after that)

Add a “Personal Records” tab: automatically calculate PRs (bench/squat/deadlift, etc.).

Deploy with Docker + Fly.io/Render for cloud deployment.

Add a PWA manifest so users can install it like a mobile app.
